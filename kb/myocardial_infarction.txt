Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow to a portion of the heart muscle is blocked, typically by a thrombus (blood clot) forming on a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery, leading to myocardial ischemia and necrosis. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involves complete occlusion of a coronary artery with transmural myocardial necrosis, while Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) involves partial occlusion or transient complete occlusion with subendocardial necrosis. The classic presentation includes sudden onset of severe chest pain, typically described as crushing, squeezing, or pressure-like sensation in the center or left side of the chest, lasting more than 20 minutes and not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. The pain may radiate to the left arm, shoulder, jaw, neck, back, or epigastrium. Associated symptoms include diaphoresis (profuse sweating), nausea, vomiting, dyspnea (shortness of breath), lightheadedness, palpitations, and sense of impending doom. However, approximately 20-30% of MIs are silent or present with atypical symptoms, particularly in elderly patients, women, and diabetics who may experience only dyspnea, fatigue, weakness, or epigastric discomfort without chest pain. Physical examination may reveal anxious, diaphoretic patient in distress, tachycardia or bradycardia, hypertension or hypotension, S4 gallop (due to decreased left ventricular compliance), new systolic murmur (if papillary muscle dysfunction or ventricular septal rupture), pulmonary crackles (if heart failure develops), jugular venous distension, and signs of cardiogenic shock (cool extremities, altered mental status, decreased urine output) in severe cases. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is essential and should be obtained within 10 minutes of presentation. STEMI shows ST-segment elevation ≥1 mm in two contiguous leads or new left bundle branch block. NSTEMI may show ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, or be normal. Serial cardiac biomarkers (troponin I or T) are elevated, with troponin being highly sensitive and specific for myocardial injury, rising 3-4 hours after onset, peaking at 24-48 hours, and remaining elevated for 7-14 days. CK-MB is less specific but useful for detecting reinfarction. Risk factors include smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia (elevated LDL, low HDL), diabetes mellitus, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, family history of premature coronary artery disease, age (men >45 years, women >55 years), male gender, postmenopausal status in women, chronic kidney disease, and cocaine use. Complications include arrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia most common in first 24 hours), heart failure, cardiogenic shock, mechanical complications (papillary muscle rupture causing acute mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal rupture, free wall rupture with cardiac tamponade), pericarditis, ventricular aneurysm, and mural thrombus with risk of systemic embolization. Immediate management follows MONA protocol (Morphine for pain, Oxygen if hypoxemic, Nitroglycerin for chest pain, Aspirin 325 mg chewed immediately) plus antiplatelet therapy (P2Y12 inhibitor like clopidogrel or ticagrelor), anticoagulation, and beta-blockers. STEMI requires urgent reperfusion therapy, preferably primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 90 minutes of first medical contact, or fibrinolytic therapy if PCI not available within 120 minutes. Post-MI management includes dual antiplatelet therapy for at least 12 months, high-intensity statin, ACE inhibitor or ARB, beta-blocker, and cardiac rehabilitation program.
