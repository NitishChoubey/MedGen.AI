Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for more than 3 months, with implications for health. CKD is characterized by either kidney damage (albuminuria, urine sediment abnormalities, electrolyte abnormalities, structural abnormalities, or history of kidney transplantation) or decreased kidney function (GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m²). The disease is staged based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): Stage 1 (GFR ≥90, kidney damage present), Stage 2 (GFR 60-89, mild reduction), Stage 3a (GFR 45-59, mild-moderate reduction), Stage 3b (GFR 30-44, moderate-severe reduction), Stage 4 (GFR 15-29, severe reduction), and Stage 5 (GFR <15, kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation). CKD often remains asymptomatic in early stages, with symptoms developing as kidney function declines. Common symptoms in advanced stages include fatigue, weakness, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, sleep disturbances, changes in urine output (polyuria initially, then oliguria), foamy urine (proteinuria), hematuria (blood in urine), peripheral edema, dyspnea due to fluid overload or anemia, pruritus (itching), restless legs, and difficulty concentrating. Physical examination may reveal hypertension (present in >80% of CKD patients), pallor (anemia), peripheral edema, pulmonary crackles (volume overload), uremic frost (urea crystallization on skin in severe uremia), pericardial friction rub (uremic pericarditis), asterixis (flapping tremor indicating uremic encephalopathy), and signs of underlying causes such as diabetic retinopathy. The most common causes of CKD include diabetes mellitus (leading cause, approximately 40% of cases causing diabetic nephropathy), hypertension (second most common, causing hypertensive nephrosclerosis), glomerulonephritis (various types including IgA nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), polycystic kidney disease, chronic interstitial nephritis, obstructive uropathy, and recurrent kidney infections. Complications of CKD include cardiovascular disease (leading cause of death in CKD patients), mineral and bone disorder (secondary hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, renal osteodystrophy), anemia (due to decreased erythropoietin production), metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hypertension, volume overload with pulmonary edema, uremia (with symptoms of nausea, confusion, seizures, pericarditis, bleeding tendency), and increased infection risk. Diagnosis involves serum creatinine to calculate eGFR using CKD-EPI equation, urinalysis to detect proteinuria and hematuria, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) with >30 mg/g indicating albuminuria, complete blood count showing anemia, comprehensive metabolic panel revealing elevated BUN, creatinine, potassium, phosphate, decreased bicarbonate and calcium, and renal ultrasound to assess kidney size and detect obstruction or structural abnormalities. Management focuses on slowing progression and treating complications. Blood pressure control is crucial with target <130/80 mmHg using ACE inhibitors or ARBs as first-line agents (also provide renoprotection by reducing proteinuria). Strict glycemic control in diabetic patients with HbA1c target <7%. Management of dyslipidemia with statins to reduce cardiovascular risk. Dietary modifications include protein restriction (0.8 g/kg/day), sodium restriction (<2 g/day), potassium restriction if hyperkalemic, phosphate restriction with phosphate binders, and adequate caloric intake. Anemia management with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron supplementation targeting hemoglobin 10-11.5 g/dL. Treatment of mineral bone disorder with vitamin D supplementation, phosphate binders, and calcimimetics if indicated. Avoiding nephrotoxic medications (NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, contrast agents) and adjusting medication doses for reduced GFR. Preparation for renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplantation) when approaching Stage 5 CKD, including vascular access creation or peritoneal catheter placement, and evaluation for transplant candidacy.
