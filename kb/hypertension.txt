Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition in which blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated, defined as systolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥80 mmHg according to current guidelines. Essential (primary) hypertension accounts for 90-95% of cases with no identifiable cause, while secondary hypertension results from underlying conditions such as renal disease, endocrine disorders, or medication side effects. Hypertension is often asymptomatic and discovered during routine screening, earning it the designation "silent killer." Some patients may experience headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, or epistaxis (nosebleed), but these are nonspecific symptoms. The condition significantly increases risk for cardiovascular complications including stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, retinopathy, and peripheral arterial disease. Blood pressure should be measured on multiple occasions to confirm diagnosis, with readings taken in both arms and patient seated comfortably for 5 minutes. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or home blood pressure monitoring may be used to confirm diagnosis and detect white coat hypertension or masked hypertension. Physical examination may reveal retinal changes on fundoscopy (arteriovenous nicking, hemorrhages, exudates, papilledema in severe cases), cardiac findings such as displaced point of maximal impulse or S4 gallop suggesting left ventricular hypertrophy, abdominal bruits suggesting renal artery stenosis, or diminished peripheral pulses. Risk factors include age (>55 years for men, >65 for women), obesity, sedentary lifestyle, excessive sodium intake, low potassium intake, excessive alcohol consumption, chronic stress, family history, African American ethnicity, and diabetes mellitus. Hypertensive urgency is defined as severe elevation (≥180/120 mmHg) without acute end-organ damage, while hypertensive emergency includes severe elevation with acute end-organ damage (encephalopathy, acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure, stroke, acute kidney injury, aortic dissection, eclampsia) requiring immediate hospitalization. Initial workup includes basic metabolic panel to assess kidney function and electrolytes, urinalysis for proteinuria and hematuria, lipid panel, ECG to detect left ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia, and possibly echocardiography. Management begins with lifestyle modifications including DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), sodium restriction (<2300 mg/day), weight loss if overweight, regular aerobic exercise (150 minutes/week), smoking cessation, and limited alcohol intake. First-line pharmacological agents include thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers, often used in combination. Target blood pressure is typically <130/80 mmHg for most patients.
