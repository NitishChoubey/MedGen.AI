Tuberculosis (TB)

Tuberculosis is a potentially serious infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body.

Common Symptoms:
- Persistent cough lasting more than 3 weeks
- Coughing up blood or sputum
- Chest pain
- Unintentional weight loss
- Fatigue and weakness
- Fever and night sweats
- Chills
- Loss of appetite

Types:
1. Latent TB: Bacteria present but inactive, no symptoms, not contagious
2. Active TB: Bacteria multiply and cause illness, contagious

Risk Factors:
- Weakened immune system (HIV/AIDS, diabetes, kidney disease)
- Close contact with infected individuals
- Living in or traveling to high-risk areas
- Poverty and malnutrition
- Substance abuse
- Healthcare work

Diagnosis:
- Tuberculin skin test (TST/PPD)
- Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs)
- Chest X-ray
- Sputum smear microscopy
- Culture tests
- Molecular tests (GeneXpert)

Treatment:
- Combination antibiotic therapy for 6-9 months
- Common medications: isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide
- Directly observed therapy (DOT) recommended
- Multi-drug resistant TB requires longer treatment with second-line drugs

Prevention:
- BCG vaccine (in high-risk countries)
- Screening and treatment of latent TB
- Infection control measures
- Isolation of active TB patients until non-contagious
