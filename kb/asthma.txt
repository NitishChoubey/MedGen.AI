Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by reversible airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and underlying inflammation. The condition manifests as recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough, particularly at night or early morning. Symptoms are typically variable in intensity and frequency, triggered by various factors including allergens (pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold), respiratory infections (especially viral), exercise, cold air, air pollutants, strong odors, emotional stress, and certain medications (aspirin, NSAIDs, beta-blockers). The pathophysiology involves complex interactions between inflammatory cells (eosinophils, mast cells, T lymphocytes), mediators, and airway structural cells leading to airway inflammation, bronchospasm, mucus hypersecretion, and airway remodeling in chronic cases. Patients typically present with episodic dyspnea, wheezing (high-pitched whistling sound during breathing), nonproductive cough that may become productive, and sensation of chest tightness. Symptoms often worsen at night, interfering with sleep, or with physical activity. Physical examination during an acute exacerbation reveals tachypnea (increased respiratory rate), tachycardia, use of accessory respiratory muscles, prolonged expiratory phase, and diffuse bilateral wheezing on auscultation. In severe attacks, patients may have difficulty speaking full sentences, sit upright leaning forward (tripod position), appear anxious or agitated, and develop cyanosis. Absence of wheezing in a severely dyspneic patient (silent chest) indicates critical airflow obstruction. Diagnosis is established through characteristic history, physical findings, and demonstration of reversible airflow obstruction on spirometry showing decreased FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio that improves by >12% and 200 mL after bronchodilator administration. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) monitoring shows variability >20% between measurements. Methacholine challenge testing may be used when spirometry is normal but asthma is suspected. Allergy testing (skin prick or serum IgE) helps identify specific triggers. Classification includes intermittent asthma (symptoms ≤2 days/week), mild persistent (symptoms >2 days/week but not daily), moderate persistent (daily symptoms), and severe persistent (continuous symptoms with frequent exacerbations). Asthma exacerbations are characterized by progressive worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness, often triggered by viral respiratory infections. Severe exacerbations require assessment of severity using peak flow measurements, oxygen saturation, and clinical signs. Risk factors include atopy (genetic predisposition to allergic disease), family history of asthma or atopy, maternal smoking during pregnancy, childhood respiratory infections, obesity, and occupational exposures. Management follows a stepwise approach based on severity and control. Quick-relief medications include short-acting beta-2 agonists (albuterol/salbutamol) for acute symptom relief. Controller medications include inhaled corticosteroids (foundation of therapy), long-acting beta-2 agonists (always combined with ICS), leukotriene modifiers, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, and biologics (omalizumab, mepolizumab) for severe allergic or eosinophilic asthma. Patient education on proper inhaler technique, trigger avoidance, self-monitoring with peak flow meter, and written asthma action plan is essential. Regular follow-up to assess control, adjust medications, and review inhaler technique is necessary.
