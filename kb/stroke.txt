Stroke, also called cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or brain attack, occurs when blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients, leading to rapid death of brain cells. Ischemic stroke accounts for approximately 87% of all strokes and results from thrombotic or embolic occlusion of a cerebral artery. Hemorrhagic stroke (13% of cases) results from rupture of a blood vessel causing intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage. The clinical presentation depends on the location and extent of brain tissue affected. Common presenting symptoms include sudden onset of focal neurological deficits: weakness or numbness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body (hemiparesis or hemiplegia), confusion, difficulty speaking or understanding speech (aphasia or dysarthria), visual disturbances (hemianopia, diplopia, or sudden vision loss), severe headache with no known cause (particularly in hemorrhagic stroke), dizziness, loss of balance or coordination (ataxia), and difficulty walking. The acronym FAST (Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call emergency services) is used for rapid stroke recognition. Large vessel occlusions may present with sudden severe deficits, while small vessel (lacunar) strokes may cause pure motor hemiparesis, pure sensory stroke, or ataxic hemiparesis. Physical examination findings vary based on location: anterior circulation strokes (carotid territory, middle cerebral artery most common) cause contralateral motor and sensory deficits, aphasia if dominant hemisphere affected, and gaze preference toward lesion side. Posterior circulation strokes (vertebrobasilar territory) cause vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, ataxia, crossed sensory or motor deficits, and may involve cranial nerve palsies. Brainstem strokes can cause locked-in syndrome or altered consciousness. Cerebellar strokes present with severe ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and nystagmus, with risk of brainstem compression. NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is used to quantify stroke severity (0-42 points, higher scores indicate more severe deficits). Risk factors include non-modifiable factors: age (risk doubles each decade after 55), male gender, race (African Americans at higher risk), and family history. Modifiable risk factors include hypertension (most important), atrial fibrillation (major cause of embolic stroke), diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol consumption, carotid artery stenosis, previous stroke or TIA, heart disease (myocardial infarction, heart failure, patent foramen ovale), and hypercoagulable states. Diagnosis requires emergency non-contrast CT scan of head to differentiate ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke (appears within minutes for hemorrhage, ischemic changes appear hours later). CT angiography or MR angiography identifies large vessel occlusions. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive for early ischemic changes. ECG to detect atrial fibrillation. Laboratory tests include glucose (hypoglycemia can mimic stroke), complete blood count, coagulation studies (PT/INR, aPTT), and cardiac biomarkers. Carotid ultrasound assesses for stenosis. Echocardiography (transthoracic or transesophageal) evaluates cardiac sources of emboli. Acute ischemic stroke management requires rapid assessment and treatment within therapeutic window. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) should be administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset in eligible patients (no contraindications like recent surgery, hemorrhage risk, severe hypertension). Mechanical thrombectomy via endovascular intervention for large vessel occlusions can be performed up to 24 hours in selected patients with favorable imaging. General management includes blood pressure management (permissive hypertension in acute phase unless >220/120 or thrombolysis candidate), glucose control, temperature control, prevention of aspiration with dysphagia screening, and DVT prophylaxis. Hemorrhagic stroke management focuses on blood pressure control (target SBP 140 mmHg if safe), reversal of anticoagulation if applicable, and neurosurgical evaluation for hematoma evacuation if indicated. Secondary stroke prevention includes antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, or aspirin-dipyridamole), anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, statin therapy for lipid management, blood pressure control, diabetes management, smoking cessation, and carotid endarterectomy or stenting for significant carotid stenosis. Rehabilitation with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy is essential for recovery.
