Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) due to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Common symptoms include polyuria (excessive urination), polydipsia (excessive thirst), polyphagia (excessive hunger), unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision. Patients may present with increased frequency of urination, especially at night (nocturia). Chronic hyperglycemia leads to long-term complications including diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and increased cardiovascular disease risk. Diagnostic criteria include fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL, random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL with symptoms, or HbA1c ≥6.5%. Physical examination may reveal acanthosis nigricans (darkened skin patches), diabetic dermopathy, or signs of peripheral neuropathy. Risk factors include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, family history, age over 45, gestational diabetes history, and certain ethnicities (African American, Hispanic, Native American, Asian American). Acute complications include diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in Type 1 diabetes, presenting with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fruity breath odor, and altered mental status. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) can occur in Type 2 diabetes with severe dehydration and altered consciousness. Management includes lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise), oral hypoglycemic agents (metformin, sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors), and insulin therapy. Regular monitoring of blood glucose, HbA1c, blood pressure, lipids, and screening for complications is essential. Patient education on glucose monitoring, medication adherence, foot care, and recognition of hypoglycemia symptoms is crucial for disease management.
