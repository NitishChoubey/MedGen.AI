Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive respiratory disorder characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. COPD encompasses chronic bronchitis and emphysema, typically caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most commonly from cigarette smoking. Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically as productive cough for at least 3 months in 2 consecutive years. Emphysema involves destruction of alveolar walls leading to enlarged air spaces and loss of elastic recoil. Common presenting symptoms include chronic progressive dyspnea (shortness of breath), initially with exertion and later at rest, chronic cough with or without sputum production, wheezing, and chest tightness. Patients often report decreased exercise tolerance and frequent respiratory infections. Physical examination may reveal barrel chest, use of accessory respiratory muscles, prolonged expiratory phase, decreased breath sounds, wheezing, and in advanced cases, cyanosis and signs of right heart failure (cor pulmonale) including peripheral edema and jugular venous distension. Spirometry is essential for diagnosis, showing post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio <0.70 confirming airflow obstruction. Severity is classified based on FEV1 percentage predicted: GOLD 1 (mild) ≥80%, GOLD 2 (moderate) 50-79%, GOLD 3 (severe) 30-49%, GOLD 4 (very severe) <30%. Chest X-ray may show hyperinflation, flattened diaphragm, increased retrosternal airspace, and bullae. Risk factors include tobacco smoking (primary cause), occupational dust and chemical exposures, indoor air pollution from biomass fuel, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and history of childhood respiratory infections. Acute exacerbations are characterized by worsening dyspnea, increased cough, change in sputum color or volume, and may be triggered by respiratory infections or air pollution. Management includes smoking cessation (most important intervention), bronchodilators (short-acting and long-acting beta-agonists, anticholinergics), inhaled corticosteroids in severe cases, pulmonary rehabilitation, supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia, and vaccinations (influenza, pneumococcal). Severe exacerbations require systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics if bacterial infection is suspected.
