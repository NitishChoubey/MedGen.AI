Heart Failure (Congestive Heart Failure)

Heart failure is a chronic condition where the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should. It doesn't mean the heart has stopped working, but that it's working less efficiently.

Common Symptoms:
- Shortness of breath during activity or at rest
- Fatigue and weakness
- Swelling in legs, ankles, and feet (edema)
- Rapid or irregular heartbeat
- Reduced ability to exercise
- Persistent cough or wheezing with white or pink blood-tinged phlegm
- Increased need to urinate at night
- Swelling of abdomen (ascites)
- Sudden weight gain from fluid retention
- Lack of appetite and nausea
- Difficulty concentrating or confusion

Types:
1. Left-sided heart failure:
   - Systolic failure (heart can't contract forcefully)
   - Diastolic failure (heart can't relax properly)
2. Right-sided heart failure
3. Congestive heart failure (both sides affected)

Common Causes:
- Coronary artery disease
- Heart attack (myocardial infarction)
- High blood pressure (hypertension)
- Faulty heart valves
- Cardiomyopathy
- Myocarditis
- Congenital heart defects
- Arrhythmias

Risk Factors:
- High blood pressure
- Coronary artery disease
- Diabetes
- Obesity
- Smoking
- Alcohol or drug abuse

Diagnosis:
- Physical examination
- Blood tests (BNP, NT-proBNP)
- Chest X-ray
- Electrocardiogram (ECG)
- Echocardiogram
- Stress test
- Cardiac catheterization
- CT or MRI scans

Treatment:
- Medications: ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics, aldosterone antagonists
- Lifestyle changes: low-sodium diet, fluid restriction, weight management
- Implantable devices (pacemakers, ICDs)
- Surgery (bypass, valve repair, transplant)
- Cardiac rehabilitation
