Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of the urinary system including kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, with most infections involving the lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra). Cystitis refers to bladder infection, while pyelonephritis refers to kidney infection. UTIs are predominantly caused by bacterial pathogens, with Escherichia coli (E. coli) accounting for 80-90% of uncomplicated UTIs, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (especially in young women), Klebsiella, Proteus, and Enterococcus species. Lower UTI (cystitis) presents with dysuria (painful, burning sensation during urination), urinary frequency (frequent urination of small amounts), urgency (sudden strong urge to urinate), suprapubic pain or discomfort, cloudy or foul-smelling urine, and hematuria (blood in urine). Patients typically remain afebrile and otherwise well-appearing. Upper UTI (pyelonephritis) presents with fever, chills, flank pain (unilateral or bilateral), costovertebral angle tenderness, nausea, vomiting, and may include lower urinary symptoms. Patients appear more systemically ill and may develop sepsis. Physical examination in cystitis shows suprapubic tenderness on palpation, while pyelonephritis demonstrates costovertebral angle tenderness on percussion. Women are at significantly higher risk than men due to shorter urethra and proximity to anus. Risk factors include female gender, sexual activity (increased risk with new partner or frequent intercourse), pregnancy, menopause, use of spermicides or diaphragms, urinary catheterization, recent urinary tract instrumentation, urinary tract abnormalities (vesicoureteral reflux, obstruction, neurogenic bladder), kidney stones, immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, and history of recurrent UTIs. Complicated UTIs occur in patients with structural or functional abnormalities, pregnancy, male gender, hospital-acquired infections, or immunocompromised states. Diagnosis in symptomatic patients involves urinalysis showing pyuria (white blood cells in urine, typically >10 WBC/hpf), bacteriuria, nitrite positive (indicates bacteria converting nitrate to nitrite), and leukocyte esterase positive (released by white blood cells). Microscopy may reveal bacteria and white blood cell casts (indicating pyelonephritis). Urine culture with colony count >100,000 CFU/mL confirms diagnosis and identifies specific pathogen with antibiotic sensitivities, though lower counts (>1,000 CFU/mL) may be significant in symptomatic patients. Blood cultures should be obtained in pyelonephritis or suspected sepsis. Complete blood count may show leukocytosis in pyelonephritis. Imaging with renal ultrasound or CT scan is indicated if pyelonephritis not responding to treatment, recurrent infections, suspected obstruction, or possible complications like abscess. Treatment of uncomplicated cystitis includes short-course antibiotics: nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 3 days (if local resistance <20%), or fosfomycin single dose. Phenazopyridine can be used for 1-2 days for symptomatic dysuria relief. Pyelonephritis requires longer antibiotic course (10-14 days) with fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) as empiric outpatient therapy, or ceftriaxone plus oral step-down for inpatient cases. Severe pyelonephritis or sepsis requires hospitalization with intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam, or carbapenems depending on severity and risk factors). Prevention strategies include adequate hydration, frequent voiding, urinating after intercourse, avoiding spermicides, considering vaginal estrogen in postmenopausal women, and prophylactic antibiotics or cranberry products for recurrent UTIs. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should be treated only in pregnancy or before urological procedures.
