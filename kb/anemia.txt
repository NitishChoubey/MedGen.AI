Anemia

Anemia is a condition in which you lack enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body's tissues. Having anemia can make you feel tired and weak.

Common Symptoms:
- Fatigue and weakness
- Pale or yellowish skin
- Irregular heartbeats
- Shortness of breath
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Chest pain
- Cold hands and feet
- Headaches
- Brittle nails
- Unusual cravings (pica)

Types and Causes:
1. Iron deficiency anemia:
   - Most common type
   - Causes: Blood loss, poor diet, inability to absorb iron, pregnancy

2. Vitamin deficiency anemia:
   - Lack of vitamin B12 or folate
   - Causes: Poor diet, pernicious anemia, intestinal problems

3. Anemia of chronic disease:
   - Associated with: Cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, Crohn's disease

4. Aplastic anemia:
   - Rare, serious condition
   - Bone marrow fails to produce enough blood cells

5. Hemolytic anemia:
   - Red blood cells destroyed faster than bone marrow can replace them
   - Can be inherited or acquired

6. Sickle cell anemia:
   - Inherited form
   - Abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid and sickle-shaped

Risk Factors:
- Poor diet lacking iron, vitamin B12, and folate
- Intestinal disorders (Crohn's disease, celiac disease)
- Menstruation and pregnancy
- Chronic conditions
- Family history
- Age (over 65)

Diagnosis:
- Complete blood count (CBC)
- Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels
- Red blood cell size and shape
- Serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels
- Vitamin B12 and folate levels
- Reticulocyte count
- Bone marrow examination (if needed)

Treatment:
- Iron supplements for iron deficiency
- Vitamin B12 injections or supplements
- Folate supplements
- Blood transfusions for severe cases
- Medications to stimulate red blood cell production
- Treatment of underlying causes
- Bone marrow transplant (severe cases)

Prevention:
- Eat iron-rich foods (red meat, beans, leafy greens)
- Consume vitamin C to enhance iron absorption
- Adequate vitamin B12 intake (meat, dairy, fortified cereals)
- Folate-rich foods (leafy greens, fruits, legumes)
- Prenatal vitamins during pregnancy
