## Slide 8: Confidence Scoring Algorithm

### Content:
```
Transparent AI: How We Calculate Confidence

Multi-Factor Scoring = Explainable Results

🏆 Rank Score (40 points)
   Higher in search results = stronger evidence

🔍 Findings Score (35 points)
   More patient symptoms match = higher confidence

📊 Relevance Score (25 points)
   Semantic similarity strength

Total: 0-100% Confidence
Plus: Severity Level (Critical / High / Medium / Low)

Example:
Heart Failure: 87% (High severity)
• Rank #1: 40 pts
• 5 matching findings: 35 pts  
• Avg relevance 0.85: 21 pts
• Urgency boost: +5 pts
```
