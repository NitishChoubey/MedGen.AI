2. Generate diagnostic hypotheses based on symptoms
3. Provide evidence from medical knowledge base"

"This means doctors can review cases in minutes instead of hours, with AI assistance to consider diagnostic possibilities they might not have immediately considered."

**Key Points:**
- Instant summarization
- AI-powered diagnostic suggestions
- Evidence-based reasoning
- Available on web and mobile

### Slide 4: The Technology (0:50-1:10)
**"Powered by Cutting-Edge AI"**

"We use:
- State-of-the-art language models from HuggingFace for medical text understanding
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with FAISS for accurate, evidence-based suggestions
- A curated medical knowledge base that grounds our AI in established medical knowledge"

"This isn't just a chatbot - it's a specialized medical AI assistant with a foundation in actual medical literature."

**Key Points:**
- Transformer models for summarization
- RAG ensures accuracy
- Medical knowledge base
- Not generic AI - specialized for healthcare
